## Training Analysis
+ evaluate the training process,
    - on what reasoning-level data is model's reward high? (what model is capable of doing)
        - reward - steps plot on reason-level 1,2,3,...
    - on what reasoning-level data is the reward std high? (suggest valuable signal)
        - reward -std plot on reason-level 1,2,3,...

## Test new idea: hierarchical reason-level training
